# Golerta

A simplified reimplementation of [alerta](https://github.com/guardian/alerta) in golang. It has an enterprise 
focus so the biggest change will be using LDAP for the authentication system. Additionally, I will be looking
to reimplement the backend in RethinkDB for simplified clustering and querying.
